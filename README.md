# Fish-E 



## Problem:

The problem that some animal lovers may face is not knowing enough about their aquariums and it's occupants specific needs. 
There are many different fish species, requiring different level of care and attention, thus making each aquarium so unique. 
A beginner could come across many complications surrounding aquarium decorations,
creating suitable conditions for fish or aquarium care in general,
whilst an intermediate or even an expert fish taker can accidentally overlook the distinctions their particular fish may need.

## Solution:
Virtual assistant that analyzes your aquarium data and gives you easy-to-follow instructions to take care of your aquarium in its inhabitants.

#What is/was done during hackaton:
build a monitoring device using A.I. to collect data about your aquarium water cleanliness
and made an app that displays the current situation in the aquarium. As well we taught of our business model.

## Next steps/ plans:
complete our product, train A.I. and present our idea to hardware inhibitors like Buildit.
